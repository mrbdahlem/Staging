# ./AGENTS.md

## Goals

1. Keep work safe, incremental, and reviewable.
2. Preserve runtime behavior unless behavior changes are explicitly requested.
3. Leave reusable context for future contributors and agents.
4. Treat TypeScript as a required project standard for new and modified application code.

## Read First

Before making changes, read these files when relevant:

1. `.agent/knowledge/*.md` (discovered patterns and optimization guidance)

## Working Rules

1. From the package root you can call `npm test`; all tests must pass before commit.
2. Treat generated outputs (`dist`, caches, `node_modules`) as out of scope for manual edits.
3. Add or update tests for the code you change, even if nobody asked.
4. Use the shared Playwright harness for browser-level coverage that crosses routing, fetch, storage, and websocket/runtime boundaries. Keep Playwright tests under the repo-root `playwright/` directory and run them with the root `npm run test:e2e` scripts rather than ad hoc browser commands.
5. Frontend controls must include appropriate accessibility semantics for their role and state. Use native elements when possible, and add relevant attributes such as `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-selected`, and `disabled` when the control behavior requires them.
6. All API endpoints must include proper error handling and logging.
7. Use structured logging for all server-side events.
8. Never expose, log, or commit secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information.
9. Plans should be iterative and include checklists of steps for the plan. Checklists must be updated as tasks are created and completed.
 
## Preflight Checklist

Before making code changes:

1. Confirm branch and working tree status. NEVER commit to `main`.
2. If unexpected unrelated file changes are discovered, pause and ask how to proceed.
3. Read relevant docs (`README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`).
4. Identify change scope (docs-only, client, server, activities, cross-workspace).
5. If requirements conflict with repository safety or deployment guarantees, escalate before continuing.

## Verification Matrix

Run these minimum checks based on scope:

1. Docs-only changes
   - Verify links/commands in changed docs are accurate.
2. Workspace specific changes
   - Run the appropriate npm workspace tests, be sure to include lint and typecheck
   - If browser-visible shared flows or routing surfaces changed, include `npm run test:e2e`
3. Cross-workspace changes
   - `npm test` (runs unit tests + typecheck + linting across all workspaces)
   - Add `npm run test:e2e` when the change affects shared client routing, activity-card surfacing, waiting-room/permalink flow, or other browser-level interaction seams
4. Sandbox/agent environments that block local port binding
   - Keep `npm test` as the primary merge gate when available.
   - If Playwright needs real local port binding, run `npm run test:e2e` in a canonical environment or with the required escalation, and record that limitation/exception in validation notes.

## Destructive Command Policy

1. Do not run destructive commands (for example: `git reset --hard`, broad `rm -rf`, forced history rewrites) unless explicitly requested.
2. If a potentially destructive action is required, ask for confirmation first.

## Import Conventions

1. Backend/runtime imports must be directly runtime-resolvable. Do not rely on bundler-only features for runtime-critical code paths unless runtime support is explicitly configured.
2. Keep cross-workspace import boundaries explicit (prefer package/export boundaries over deep ad-hoc paths).

## Frontend Accessibility

1. Prefer semantic HTML elements that already expose the correct accessibility role and keyboard behavior.
2. Treat visual-only state as insufficient. If a control has expanded/collapsed, pressed, selected, active, disabled, invalid, or busy state, expose that state with the appropriate native or ARIA attribute.
3. Icon-only controls must have an accessible name.
4. When creating or changing custom interactive components, verify keyboard interaction and screen-reader semantics along with visual behavior.

## Temporary Workaround Policy

1. Any temporary compatibility shim or workaround must include:
   - inline reason
   - owner
   - cleanup condition or target date

## Release-Impact Rule

If a change affects runtime, build, or deployment behavior:

1. Update `DEPLOYMENT.md` in the same PR.
2. Update `README.md` quick-start/build/run commands as needed.
3. Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` if system boundaries or runtime flow changed.

## Ownership and Escalation

1. If unexpected unrelated file changes are discovered, pause and ask how to proceed.
2. If requirements conflict with repository safety or deployment guarantees, escalate before continuing.

## Evidence and Tracking

Use these logs to keep work auditable:

1. `.agent/knowledge/repo_discoveries.md`
   - Durable notes/discoveries for future work.
2. `.agent/knowledge/react-best-practices.md`
   - React patterns, optimizations, and accessibility guidance.
3. `.agent/knowledge/testing-patterns.md`
   - Shared testing setups, failure patterns, and reliability guidance.
4. `.agent/knowledge/deployment-notes.md`
   - Environment/runtime deployment constraints and operational learnings.
5. `.agent/knowledge/data-contracts.md`
   - API contracts, payload assumptions, and compatibility expectations.
6. `.agent/knowledge/performance-notes.md`
   - Profiling findings, bottlenecks, and optimization tradeoffs.
7. `.agent/knowledge/security-notes.md`
   - Security boundaries, validation rules, and sensitive-data handling guidance.

If a log file is missing, create it when first needed.
If a discovery does not fit an existing knowledge file, create a new `.agent/knowledge/<category>.md` file and define its purpose at the top. Prefer extending an existing category first; create a new category only when the topic is durable and likely to be reused.

## Definition of Done (General)

1. Relevant tests pass.
2. Documentation is updated for any workflow/runtime/build change.
3. Notes are recorded in the appropriate log files.
4. If following a plan, appropriate step(s) are marked as complete.
